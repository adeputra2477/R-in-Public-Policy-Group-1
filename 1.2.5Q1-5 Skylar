# Answer: There are 34 rows and 8 columns in penguins.

?penguins
#Answer: The bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data frame describes the depth of the penguin's bill (in millimeters). 
#3
ggplot(
  data = penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)
) + 
  geom_point()
#> Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
#Answer:3.There is a positive, linear relationship between bill depth and bill length of penguins.
#4
ggplot(
  data = penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = species)
) + 
  geom_point()
#> Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
#Answer: The scatterplot plots points vertically for each species along the x-axis.
#A scatterplot is not that useful for visualizing a continuous variable (bill_depth_mm) against a categorical variable (species) as it’s difficult to use it to describe the distribution of bill depth across species, a boxplot or violin plot would be more appropriate.
#5
# Answer: The given code doesn’t specify aesthetic mappings for x and y, which are required for for the point geom.
# Fix: Add aesthetic mappings to geom_point. For example, if you want to create a scatterplot of bill_length_mm vs. bill_depth_mm, you can use the following code: 
ggplot(
  data = penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)
) + 
  geom_point()
