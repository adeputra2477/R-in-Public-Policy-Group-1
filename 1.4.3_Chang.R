# 1.4.3
# 1. Make a bar plot of species of penguins, where you assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?

ggplot(penguins, aes(y = species)) +
  geom_bar()

# Answer: When we assign 'species' to the y aesthetic, the x-axis and y-axis of the bar plot are switched. The species are displayed in 3 rows, and the width of the bar represents the count of data point of each row.

# 2.How are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic, color or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(color = "red")

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "red")

# answer: The first graph shows the color on the border of each bar, and the second graph shows the color inside the bars. Since the bar graphs are separated and not adjacent by categories, coloring the border is ineffective.

# 3. What does the bins argument in geom_histogram() do?

# answer: The bins argument in geom_histogram() controls the number of bins used to divide the range of data into intervals for a histogram. Each bin represents a range of values, and the height of the bar represents the count of data points within that range.

# 4.Make a histogram of the carat variable in the diamonds dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package. Experiment with different binwidths. What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)

# answer: The range of carat is between 0.2 and 5.1, but most of the data is between 0.2 and 2. Additionally, diamonds are typically traded in increments of 0.1 carats, making a bandwidth of 0.1 intuitive and easy to understand.
